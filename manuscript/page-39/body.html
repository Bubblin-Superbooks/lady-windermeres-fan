Oh, don’t imagine I mind about the money.  As far as I am concerned, you may squander everything we have.  But what I <em>do</em> mind is that you who have loved me, you who have taught me to love you, should pass from the love that is given to the love that is bought.  Oh, it’s horrible!  [<em>Sits on sofa</em>.]  And it is I who feel degraded! <em>you</em> don’t feel anything.  I feel stained, utterly stained.  You can’t realise how hideous the last six months seems to me now—every kiss you have given me is tainted in my memory.</p><p>Lord Windermere.  [<em>Crossing to her</em>.]  Don’t say that, Margaret.  I never loved any one in the whole world but you.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  [<em>Rises</em>.]  Who is this woman, then?  Why do you take a house for her?</p><p>Lord Windermere.
