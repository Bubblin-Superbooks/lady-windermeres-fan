<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Duchess of Berwick.  Agatha, you say the most silly things possible.  I think on the whole that Grosvenor Square would be a more healthy place to reside in.  There are lots of vulgar people live in Grosvenor Square, but at any rate there are no horrid kangaroos crawling about.  But we’ll talk about that to-morrow.  James, you can take Agatha down.  You’ll come to lunch, of course, James.  At half-past one, instead of two.  The Duke will wish to say a few words to you, I am sure.</p><p>Hopper.  I should like to have a chat with the Duke, Duchess.  He has not said a single word to me yet.</p><p>Duchess of Berwick.  I think you’ll find he will have a great deal to say to you to-morrow.  [<em>Exit</em> Lady Agatha <em>with</em> Mr. Hopper.]  And now good-night, Margaret.  I’m afraid it’s the old, old story, dear.  Love—well, not love at first sight, but love at the end of the season, which is so much more satisfactory.</p></div> </div>
