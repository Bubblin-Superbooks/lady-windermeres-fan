You are to take Lord Windermere down to your club at once, and keep him there as long as possible.  You understand?</p><p>Lord Augustus.

Your reward?  Your reward?  Oh! ask me that to-morrow.  But don’t let Windermere out of your sight to-night.  If you do I will never forgive you.  I will never speak to you again.
