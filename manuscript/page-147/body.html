<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Child, you and she belong to different worlds.  Into your world evil has never entered.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  Don’t say that, Arthur.  There is the same world for all of us, and good and evil, sin and innocence, go through it hand in hand.  To shut one’s eyes to half of life that one may live securely is as though one blinded oneself that one might walk with more safety in a land of pit and precipice.</p><p>Lord Windermere.  [<em>Moves down with her</em>.]  Darling, why do you say that?</p><p>Lady Windermere.  [<em>Sits on sofa</em>.]  Because I, who had shut my eyes to life, came to the brink.  And one who had separated us—</p><p>Lord Windermere.  We were never separated.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  We never must be again.  O Arthur, don’t love me less, and I will trust you more.  I will trust you absolutely.  Let us go to Selby.  In the Rose Garden at Selby the roses are white and red.</p></div> </div>
