<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Lady Windermere, I am so sorry about your fan.  I can’t imagine how I made such a silly mistake.  Most stupid of me.  And as I was driving in your direction, I thought I would take the opportunity of returning your property in person with many apologies for my carelessness, and of bidding you good-bye.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  Good-bye?  [<em>Moves towards sofa with</em> Mrs. Erlynne <em>and sits down beside her</em>.]  Are you going away, then, Mrs. Erlynne?</p><p>Mrs. Erlynne.  Yes; I am going to live abroad again.  The English climate doesn’t suit me.  My—heart is affected here, and that I don’t like.  I prefer living in the south.  London is too full of fogs and—and serious people, Lord Windermere.  Whether the fogs produce the serious people or whether the serious people produce the fogs, I don’t know, but the whole thing rather gets on my nerves, and so I’m leaving this afternoon by the Club Train.</p></div> </div>
