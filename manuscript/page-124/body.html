Arthur, Arthur, don’t talk so bitterly about any woman.  I don’t think now that people can be divided into the good and the bad as though they were two separate races or creations.  What are called good women may have terrible things in them, mad moods of recklessness, assertion, jealousy, sin.  Bad women, as they are termed, may have in them sorrow, repentance, pity, sacrifice.  And I don’t think Mrs. Erlynne a bad woman—I know she’s not.</p><p>Lord Windermere.  My dear child, the woman’s impossible.  No matter what harm she tries to do us, you must never see her again.  She is inadmissible anywhere.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  But I want to see her.  I want her to come here.</p><p>Lord Windermere.  Never!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Lady Windermere.  She came here once as <em>your</em> guest. </p></div> </div>
