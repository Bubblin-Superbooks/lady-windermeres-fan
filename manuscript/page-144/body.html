There is nothing in the world so respectable as a good Shrewsbury and Talbot.  And now, dear Lady Windermere, I am afraid it is really good-bye.  [_Moves up C._]  Oh, I remember.  You’ll think me absurd, but do you know I’ve taken a great fancy to this fan that I was silly enough to run away with last night from your ball.  Now, I wonder would you give it to me?  Lord Windermere says you may.  I know it is his present.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  Oh, certainly, if it will give you any pleasure.  But it has my name on it.  It has ‘Margaret’ on it.</p><p>Mrs. Erlynne.  But we have the same Christian name.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  Oh, I forgot.  Of course, do have it.  What a wonderful chance our names being the same!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Mrs. Erlynne.  Quite wonderful.  Thanks—it will</p></div> </div>
