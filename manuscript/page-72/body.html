[<em>Sits down on sofa</em>.]</p><p>Lord Darlington.  And you would take him back!  You are not what I thought you were.  You are just the same as every other woman.  You would stand anything rather than face the censure of a world, whose praise you would despise.  In a week you will be driving with this woman in the Park.  She will be your constant guestâ€”your dearest friend.  You would endure anything rather than break with one blow this monstrous tie.  You are right.  You have no courage; none!</p><p>Lady Windermere.  Ah, give me time to think.  I cannot answer you now.  [<em>Passes her hand nervously over her brow</em>.]</p><p>Lord Darlington.  It must be now or not at all.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  [<em>Rising from the sofa</em>.]  Then, not at all!  [<em>A pause</em>.]</p></div> </div>
