<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Lady Windermere.  Oh, I can’t believe it!</p><p>Duchess of Berwick.  But it’s quite true, my dear.  The whole of London knows it.  That is why I felt it was better to come and talk to you, and advise you to take Windermere away at once to Homburg or to Aix, where he’ll have something to amuse him, and where you can watch him all day long.  I assure you, my dear, that on several occasions after I was first married, I had to pretend to be very ill, and was obliged to drink the most unpleasant mineral waters, merely to get Berwick out of town.  He was so extremely susceptible.  Though I am bound to say he never gave away any large sums of money to anybody.  He is far too high-principled for that!</p><p>Lady Windermere.  [<em>Interrupting</em>.]  Duchess, Duchess, it’s impossible!  [<em>Rising and crossing stage to C._]  We are only married two years.  Our child is but six months old.
