Why, there are lots of people who say I have never really done anything wrong in the whole course of my life.  Of course they only say it behind my back.</p><p>Duchess of Berwick.  Isn’t he dreadful?  Agatha, this is Lord Darlington.  Mind you don’t believe a word he says.  [Lord Darlington <em>crosses R.C._]  No, no tea, thank you, dear.  [_Crosses and sits on sofa</em>.]  We have just had tea at Lady Markby’s.  Such bad tea, too.  It was quite undrinkable.  I wasn’t at all surprised.  Her own son-in-law supplies it.  Agatha is looking forward so much to your ball to-night, dear Margaret.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  [_Seated L.C._]  Oh, you mustn’t think it is going to be a ball, Duchess.  It is only a dance in honour of my birthday.  A small and early.</p><p>Lord Darlington.  [_Standing L.C._]  Very small, very early, and very select, Duchess.</p></div> </div>
