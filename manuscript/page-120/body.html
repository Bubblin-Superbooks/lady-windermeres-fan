Have you found out at what time Lord Windermere came in last night?</p><p>Rosalie.  His lordship did not come in till five o’clock.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  Five o’clock?  He knocked at my door this morning, didn’t he?</p><p>Rosalie.  Yes, my lady—at half-past nine.  I told him your ladyship was not awake yet.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  Did he say anything?</p><p>Rosalie.  Something about your ladyship’s fan.  I didn’t quite catch what his lordship said.  Has the fan been lost, my lady?  I can’t find it, and Parker says it was not left in any of the rooms.  He has looked in all of them and on the terrace as well.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  It doesn’t matter.  Tell Parker not to trouble.  That will do.</p><p>[<em>Exit</em> Rosalie.]</p></div> </div>
