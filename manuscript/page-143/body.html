You must not bring misery into your husband’s life.  Why spoil his love?  You must not spoil it.  Love is easily killed.  Oh! how easily love is killed.  Pledge me your word, Lady Windermere, that you will never tell him.  I insist upon it.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  [<em>With bowed head</em>.]  It is your will, not mine.</p><p>Mrs. Erlynne.  Yes, it is my will.  And never forget your child—I like to think of you as a mother.  I like you to think of yourself as one.</p><p>Lady Windermere.  [<em>Looking up</em>.]  I always will now.  Only once in my life I have forgotten my own mother—that was last night.  Oh, if I had remembered her I should not have been so foolish, so wicked.</p><p>Mrs. Erlynne.  [<em>With a slight shudder</em>.]  Hush, last night is quite over.</p><p>[<em>Enter</em> Lord Windermere.]</p></div> </div>
