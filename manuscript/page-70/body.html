<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">to this wretched woman, whom he has thrust into your society, into your home, to shame you before every one.  I offer you my life—</p><p>Lady Windermere.  Lord Darlington!</p><p>Lord Darlington.  My life—my whole life.  Take it, and do with it what you will. . . . I love you—love you as I have never loved any living thing.  From the moment I met you I loved you, loved you blindly, adoringly, madly!  You did not know it then—you know it now!  Leave this house to-night.  I won’t tell you that the world matters nothing, or the world’s voice, or the voice of society.  They matter a great deal.  They matter far too much.  But there are moments when one has to choose between living one’s own life, fully, entirely, completely—or dragging out some false, shallow, degrading existence that the world in its hypocrisy demands.  You have that moment now.  Choose!  Oh, my love, choose.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Lady Windermere.  [<em>Moving slowly away from him</em>,</p></div> </div>
